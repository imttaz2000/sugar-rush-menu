# Sugar Rush | Retro Dessert Diner Menu

A single-page retro diner menu built as part of the Cod√©dex HTML Final Project.

## Description

I created a fully styled retro dessert diner menu page using only HTML. All visual styling was done with internal CSS inside a `<style>` tag within the HTML file.

## Features

- A custom header with a logo and navigation links  
- A menu section with three illustrated dessert cards (`<article>`)  
- A functional order form using `<form>`, number inputs, checkboxes, and a text area  
- A seamless dessert-themed tile background  
- Responsive layout using Flexbox  
- A consistent pastel colour scheme and playful, diner-style font  

## What I Learned

- Structuring HTML with semantic tags like `<section>`, `<article>`, `<form>`, and `<nav>`  
- Using internal CSS to control layout, fonts, spacing, colours, and hover effects  
- Creating anchor links for same-page navigation  
- Hosting projects using GitHub and GitHub Pages  

## Challenges I Faced

- Positioning and spacing elements with Flexbox  
- Making sure everything aligned and looked balanced visually  
- Adjusting background images to avoid overpowering the design  
- Learning how to upload and link assets correctly in GitHub
